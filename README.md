# pygame space invaders
I tried to familiarise myself with pygame and implemented
a very rudimental 2D space invaders "clone".  
The following tutorial on a simple racing game served as inspiration:

note: if you observe high single core usage (perhaps even maxed out), uninstall pygame and install the latest dev version
```bash
pip uninstall pygame
pip install "pygame>=2.0.0.dev1"
```
